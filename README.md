Meetup
MeetUp is an online application that enables a group of people to coordinate the scheduling of a shared event.
Once users set their own persistent schedule of available vs. occupied timeslots, MeetUp propagates that information to every associated event, allowing everybody to seamlessly schedule a time that works for them all.
